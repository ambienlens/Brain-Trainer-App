# Brain Trainer App
DEBAYAN MAJUMDER 2020

This is an android application based in Java and XML Layout. This app is created to check your mathematics level
based on the difficulty you choose and the time the difficulty offers. The app is over 350 lines of code and you
can use it in your personal project but make sure to add my name too. It makes me feel good ;)

I tried to make this app as minimalist as possible and I developed this application in Android Studio and now
after some months of development I am finally uploading my script to GitHub.

This Script has more than 25versions(debugs included)
